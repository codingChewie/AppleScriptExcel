## Excel AppleScript

This is a collection of AppleScript Excel scripts that I build, find or test while scripting against Microsoft Excel to increase my production.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Apple's Script Editor
- Microsoft Excel

## Deployment

- Download any script in the repo
- Open Microsoft Excel workbook (optionalable depending on script)
- Open script in Script Editor
- Click the play button in Script Editor

If you would like a detailed event log of what is going on when the script is running make sure to click the page icon at the bottom of Script Editor. When you hover over the icons it will say "Show or hide log"
