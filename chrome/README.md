## Chrome AppleScript

This is a collection of AppleScripts I use to manipulate Google Chrome. All scripts are broken down to a basic handler and can be called upon in the terminal with osascript. I've minified multiple lines to a single line for readability and created simple camel case variables to help anyone that is learning to step through the code. If you need the handler to be broken down to it's basic form please leave a comment below the script and I will unminify and comment what is going on.

## Deployment

- Download any script in the repo
- Open script in Script Editor
- Depending on Script Editor version it may need to be compiled (shortcut command+K)
- Click the play button in Script Editor
- You can also call on any script with something like:

```
do shell script "osascript /path/to/file.scpt"
```
